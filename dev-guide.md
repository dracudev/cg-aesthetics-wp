## Risk Management

### Potential Risks & Mitigation

1. **Booking Plugin Compatibility**

   - Risk: Selected plugin may not integrate well with GraphQL
   - Mitigation: Evaluate multiple options early; consider custom REST API endpoints

2. **Content Migration Issues**

   - Risk: Delays due to content preparation
   - Mitigation: Start content collection in Phase 1; provide templates

3. **Performance Issues**

   - Risk: Heavy media assets impact load times
   - Mitigation: Implement image optimization pipeline; use modern formats (WebP/AVIF)

4. **Browser Compatibility**

   - Risk: Booking system may not work on older browsers
   - Mitigation: Test early and often; implement polyfills where necessary

5. **Timeline Delays**
   - Risk: Phases may extend beyond estimates
   - Mitigation: Build buffer time; prioritize MVP features

---

## Assumptions

1. Client will provide all content (text, images, branding) in a timely manner
2. Booking system will integrate with WordPress via API
3. Domain and hosting accounts will be accessible
4. Client has rights to all media assets provided
5. Design mockups/wireframes will be approved before development begins
6. Third-party services (Google Maps, email) are properly configured

---

## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

The following items are not included in the MVP but may be considered for future phases:

- E-commerce functionality for product sales
- Gift card purchase and management
- Mobile app development
- Multiple language support (i18n)
- Customer portal with booking history
- Loyalty program integration
- Blog/content marketing section
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Social media integration feeds
- Live chat support
- Payment processing integration
- Membership/subscription packages
